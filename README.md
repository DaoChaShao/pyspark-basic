**LICENCE**

This project is open source and available under the **[BSD-3-Clause Licence](LICENCE)**.

In simple terms, this is a very permissive licence that allows you to freely use this code for almost any purpose,
including in proprietary projects, as long as you include the original copyright and licence notice.

**ENVIRONMENT SETUP**
---

This project uses **Python 3.12** and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast dependency management and virtual
environment handling. The required Python version is automatically detected from the [.python-version](.python-version)
file.

1. **Installing uv**:  
   If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it using the following command:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    # This installation method works on macOS and Linux.
    ```
   Alternatively, you can install it by running the following PowerShell command:
    ```bash
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    # This installation method works on Windows.
    ```
   **💡 Recommended**: For the best experience, install `uv` as a standalone tool. Avoid installing it within `pip` or
   `conda` environments to prevent potential dependency conflicts.
2. **Initialise uv**：
   Initialise `uv` by running the following command:
    ```bash
    uv init
    ```
   If you encounter any issues during the initialisation process, please delete the `pyproject.toml` file initially.
3. **Adding Dependencies**:

- To add a main (production) dependency:
    ```bash
    uv add <package_name>
    # This automatically updates pyproject.toml and installs the package
    ```
- To add a development dependency:
    ```bash
    uv add <package_name> --group dev
    # Example: uv add ruff --group dev
    # This adds the package to the [project.optional-dependencies.dev] section automatically
    ```
- To add other types of optional dependencies (e.g., test, docs):
    ```bash
    uv add <package_name> --group test
    uv add <package_name> --group docs
    ```
- To import dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    uv add -r requirements.txt
    # This reads packages from requirements.txt and adds them to pyproject.toml
    ```
- Generate a `requirements.txt` file from the current dependencies:
    ```bash
    # This exports all dependencies, including optional ones, to requirements-all.txt
    uv export > requirements.txt
    # This exports only main dependencies to requirements-main.txt
    uv export --format requirements.txt --no-hashes --no-annotate -o requirements.txt
    ```

4. Removing Dependencies

- To remove a main (production) dependency:
    ```bash
    uv remove <package_name>
    # This automatically updates pyproject.toml and removes the package
    ```
- To remove a development dependency:
    ```bash
    uv remove <package_name> --group dev
    # Example: uv remove ruff --group dev
    # This removes the package from the [project.optional-dependencies.dev] section
    ```
- To remove other types of optional dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv remove <package_name> --group test
    uv remove <package_name> --group docs
    ```

5. **Managing the Environment**

- After using add/remove commands, sync the environment:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

**CHANGELOG**
---

This project uses [git-changelog](https://github.com/pawamoy/git-changelog) to automatically generate and maintain a
changelog based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   pip install git-changelog
   # or use uv to add it as a development dependency
   uv add git-changelog --group dev
   ```
2. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   pip show git-changelog
   # or check the version specifically
   pip show git-changelog | grep Version
   ```
3. **Configuration**
   Ensure you have a properly configured `pyproject.toml` file at the project root. The configuration should specify
   Conventional Commits as the changelog style. Here is an example configuration:
   ```toml
   [tool.git-changelog]
   version = "0.1.0"
   style = "conventional-commits"
   output = "CHANGELOG.md"
   ```
4. **Generate Changelog**
   ```bash
   git-changelog --output CHANGELOG.md
   # Or use uv to run it if installed as a dev dependency
   uv run git-changelog --output CHANGELOG.md
   ```
   This command creates or updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file with all changes based on your git history.
5. **Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
   Alternatively, use your IDE's Git interface (e.g., `Git → Push` in many editors).
6. **Note**:

- The changelog is automatically generated from your commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification.
- Run the generation command whenever you want to update the changelog, typically before a release or after significant
  changes.
